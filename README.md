# DecrementingPattern
Creates a pattern using recursion

Time efficiency should be O(n) with regards to amount of changes made on an array,
but could definitely be optimized more within O(n)

Start could be modified to allow the user to input the max value and size, although that would allow element values to go below 0 (would look ugly)

Start could also be modified to allow user to input max value and a min value, with an algorithm for size to ensure the min value is reached
